# GenCast Weather Forecasting

This project demonstrates a simple weather forecasting dashboard built with Streamlit. Predictions are generated using a minimal `GenCast` model included in this repository.

## Running the app

Install the required dependencies and start the Streamlit server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The dashboard allows you to select an hour of the day and view deterministic temperature and humidity predictions along with a 24â€‘hour forecast.
